The entire page, including its data, is\n * pre-rendered into HTML at build time. This ensures fast\n * initial page loads and excellent SEO.\n *\n * 1.  **Build Time:** At `next build`, this Server Component\n *     fetches `CLASSROOM_QUESTIONS` and `CLASSROOM_EXAMS` data\n *     and renders the HTML.\n * 2.  **Deployment:** The generated HTML, CSS, and minimal\n *     JavaScript are deployed and served from a CDN.\n * 3.  **Browser:** The browser receives the full HTML. Any\n *     interactive elements (like tab switching, theme toggles)\n *     are \"hydrated\" by the `ClassroomClient` component on the\n *     client-side.\n *\n * Why SSG?\n *   - **Static Content:** Classroom questions and exam data are\n *     immutable game content that doesn't change frequently.\n *   - **Performance & SEO:** Pre-rendering at build time results\n *     in very fast loading times and is optimal for search engines.\n *   - **Separation of Concerns:** Data fetching and initial HTML\n *     generation occur on the server (in this `page.tsx`), while\n *     client-side interactivity is encapsulated in `ClassroomClient.tsx`.\n * ============================================================\n */\n\nimport ClassroomClient from \"./ClassroomClient\";\nimport
